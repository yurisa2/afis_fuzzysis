# Test Data
Had to remove original data templates because of GitHub weak support for large files (bitbucket is reaaaaaally more robust), but GitHub has a larger *userbase*....so.... you know..


## Kaggle
I have a kaggle account, I use it to test and all, but I think browser editing is really a pain in the butt (very hard to develop, but great for testing), so... I download the data and use as a repository...

Data suited for main.R and main_parallel_cpu.R can be found on

I will upload a ton of Forex data too, just wait.

But the system is generalized for any kind of data.
I develop this for rainfall prediction, my masters degree project....

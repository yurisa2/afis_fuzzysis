# Fuzzy Binary Classificator
*The name can change later, but for now I will go with **Adversarial Fuzzy Inference System (afis)***


Ok, this is my baby, my pride and joy. My sweet little baby....

It generates two independent fuzzy systems (FISs) and they rate the probability of sucess (1 or 0), and then I can evaluate.

I'm using it mainly for financial (Forex and Stocks) binary classifications, but it was developed using weather data on a paper being revised, it works both ways.

Will post some results and serious stuff here when I find the time to convert the code for S4 OOP. For now, only R procedural scripts.

## Masters degree
This is my masters degree project, I'm enrolled on a really serious program and hope to defend my thesis there... wish my luck.
*Spoiler: it can achieve 92% for positive prediction. **THATS HUGE***
## Kaggle
I have a kaggle account, I use it to test and all, but I think browser editing is really a pain in the butt (very hard to develop, but great for testing), so... I download the data and use as a repository...

Data suited for main.R and main_parallel_cpu.R can be found on
- https://www.kaggle.com/yurisa2/b3-win-2017-2018 and
- https://www.kaggle.com/yurisa2/eurusd-2014-2018

I will upload a ton of Forex data too, just wait.

But the system is generalized for any kind of data.
I develop this for rainfall prediction, my masters degree project....
